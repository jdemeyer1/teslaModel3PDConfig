## Delivery Day
I used this [checklist](https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep) to review my Model 3 on Delivery Day.  When I arrived home, I was curious about many things.  I really wanted to go for another ride so I invited my son to join me and off we went.  I recommend just driving to learn about the control, the regenerative braking, and the acceleration!
That first night, I sat in the driver's seat reading, learning, and experimenting.  This is a list of set ups and learnings.

## Set Up
### Floor Mats
I had ordered [floor mats](https://www.taptes.com/products/taptes-3d-all-weather-floor-mats-for-tesla-model-3) for the Model 3.  Before I did anything else, I wanted to install them to protect the original floor.  When I opened the driver's side door, I found specs of dust and dirt from my shoes.  The passenger side was the same.  I vacuumed both sides before installing the floor mats.  Note that my Model 3 did not have OEM floor mats.

### Wi-Fi
I set up the Model 3 to connect to my wi-fi network.  According to the manual, wi-fi is often faster than cellular networks.  I found it helpful to have the password of my network available.
Touch the cellular icon at the top left of the screen.  The Model 3 displays a list of networks it found.  Select a network for connection, enter the password, and touch Confirm.

### Learn the Menus
From the main screen, there is the Controls menu, the Cards area, an App Launcher, and the Tesla About Box.  In my opinion, learn and use these menus only while in Park.

The Controls menu displays a menu of vehicle control items.  I found it beneficial to learn and experiment with each menu item.  Many of the controls have an "Automated" setting.  This reduces driver distraction and improves safety.  While I made changes to many items, I left them in an "Automated" setting.  As I learn more about driving the Model 3, I might make changes.

Cards

The App Launcher displays applications available from the Model 3.  I expect these to change over time.  I found the Energy application to be intriguing.  I expect to use this to learn how to use the Model 3 energy to improve range.  Some of the remaining applications are available through other areas of the Touchscreen.  I do not expect to use the Calendar or the Phone.

Lastly, touch the Tesla logo at the top of the screen to display the Tesla About Box.  In the About Box, there is a link to the Owner's Manual at the lower left.  At the center top of the About Box, swipe down to display Easter Eggs.  I encourage you to try a few games in the Tesla Arcade!

### My First Charging Experience
I used the OEM equipment to charge the Model 3 from a 120 volt socket.  I installed the 120 volt adapter into the Mobile Connector (the larger end).  When I plugged the adapter into the socket, a reassuring green light appeared behind the word Tesla.

There are three methods of opening the charging port: from the Touchscreen, a double-click on the charging plug (the smaller end of the Mobile Connector), and pressing the lower right edge of the charging port.  Once it was open, I waited for the Tesla log to turn blue and inserted the charging plug.  The Tesla logo flashed green indicating to the Model 3 was charging.

The next day, I wanted to disconnect the charging plug from the Model 3.  When I pulled on it, it would not come out.  NOTE: the charging plug is locked in place.  After I turned on the Model 3, it unlocked the charging plug and I was able to remove the it.  Alternative, press and hold the button on the charging plug to release the lock.

### Locked Car Acknowledgement
After the Model 3 locks, it flashes its lights and toots its horn.  Having this acknowledgement occur early in the morning could be annoying.  This is configurable.  From the Touchscreen, select Controls -> Locks.  Disable the Lock Confirmation Sound.

### Autopilot
While I was out for a drive, I attempted to engage Autopilot.  I discovered Autopilot is delivered in a disabled state.  That is, Autopilot is installed but could not engage.  I think this is a good thing.  I recommend driving the car a few miles to get a feel for its behaviors.

From the Touchscreen, select Controls -> Autopilot.  Enable Autosteer (Beta).  I agree and support the warnings and recommendation from Tesla on using this feature.  I strongly recommend reading about the various settings available in Autopilot before using it.  I strongly recommend learning to drive the Model 3 without Autopilot so that you are prepared and confident should something unexpected occur.
