## Delivery Day
I used this [checklist](https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep) to review my Model 3 on Delivery Day.  When I arrived home, I was curious about many things.  I really wanted to go for another ride so I invited my son to join me and off we went.  I recommend just driving to learn about the control, the regenerative braking, and the acceleration!
That first night, I sat in the driver's seat reading, learning, and experimenting.  This is a list of set ups and learnings.

## Set Up
### Floor Mats
I had ordered [floor mats](https://www.taptes.com/products/taptes-3d-all-weather-floor-mats-for-tesla-model-3) for the Model 3.  Before I did anything else, I wanted to install them to protect the original floor.  When I opened the driver's side door, I found specs of dust and dirt from my shoes.  The passenger side was the same.  I vacuumed both sides before installing the floor mats.  Note that my Model 3 did not have OEM floor mats.

### Wi-Fi
I set up the Model 3 to connect to my wi-fi network.  According to the manual, wi-fi is often faster than cellular networks.  I found it helpful to have the password of my network available.
Touch the cellular icon at the top left of the screen.  The Model 3 displays a list of networks it found.  Select a network for connection, enter the password, and touch Confirm.

### Learn the Menus
From the main screen, there is the Controls menu, an App Launcher, and the Tesla About Box.  In my opinion, learn and use these menus only while in Park.
The Controls menu displays a menu of vehicle control items.  I found it beneficial to learn and experiment with each menu item.  Many of the controls have an "Automated" setting.  This reduces driver distraction and improves safety.  While I made changes to many items, I left them in an "Automated" setting.  As I learn more about driving the Model 3, I might make changes.
The App Launcher displays applications available from the Model 3.  I expect these to change over time.  I found the Energy application to be intriguing.  I expect to use this to learn how to use the Model 3 energy to improve range.
