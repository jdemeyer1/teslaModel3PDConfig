## Delivery Day
I used this [checklist](https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep) to review my Model 3 on Delivery Day.  When I arrived home, I was curious about many things.  I really wanted to go for another ride so I invited my son to join me and off we went.  I recommend just driving to learn about the control, the regenerative braking, and the acceleration!
That first night, I sat in the driver's seat reading, learning, and experimenting.  This is a list of set ups and learnings.

## Set Up
### Floor Mats
I had ordered [floor mats](https://www.taptes.com/products/taptes-3d-all-weather-floor-mats-for-tesla-model-3) for the Model 3.  Before I did anything else, I wanted to install them to protect the original floor.  When I opened the driver's side door, I found specs of dust and dirt from my shoes.  The passenger side was the same.  I vacuumed both sides before installing the floor mats.  Note that my Model 3 did not have OEM floor mats.

I set up the Model 3 to connect to my wi-fi network.  According to the manual, wi-fi is often faster than cellular networks.  I found it helpful to have the password of my network available.
Touch the cellular icon at the top left of the screen.  The Model 3 displays a list of networks it found.  Select network for connection, enter the password, and touch Confirm.
